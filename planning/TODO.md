TODO List
=======

SmartJs is a labor of love I do before work, on lunch break, and after work until the wee hours.  I have a lot of ideas about things I want to include, but not enough time to do them all.  This document is to help keep track of the Tasks in the near future that need to be done.

/client
-------
* security via Oauth
* caching requests for data
* separation of concerns for data and group services provided by Server
* phonegap splash screen
* work on form validation concept
* implement client to client PM feature
* demonstrate Phonegap API around a device feature, probaby camera, so implement chat room picture feature
* implement Hackbook as an AMD module
* testing on other devices and different layouts

/server
-------
* needs a refactor
* needs comments deleted and added
* add in use of lodash

/database
-------
* need to break out the ensureIndex calls in /server/dataProvider into a separate dbCreation.js script and move to /database

/qa
-------
* create a build for the html/css
* create a xcopy batch that combines the built html/css and the currently built js
* create a batch that copies out this built version to the android project assets/www
* need to use git branching

/planning
